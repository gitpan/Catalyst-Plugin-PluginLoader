NAME
    Catalyst::Plugin::PluginLoader - Load Catalyst Plugins from Config

SYNOPSIS
      <Plugin::PluginLoader>
          plugins Session
          plugins Session::Store::FastMmap
          plugins Session::State::Cookie
      </Plugin::PluginLoader>

      use Catalyst qw/ConfigLoader PluginLoader/;

DESCRIPTION
    Allows you to load Catalyst plugins from your app config file.

    Plugin order is the same as if you put the plugins after PluginLoader in
    the "use Catalyst" line.

    This is a COLOSSAL HACK and is not guaranteed to work.

    Please report bugs at <http://rt.cpan.org/>.
